# Exzo-Network-Smart-Contracts
## The official repository for all of the Exzo Network's smart contracts.

## Smart Contract Security Protocol

* All code stored in a version control system, such as git
* All code modifications made via Pull Requests
* All Pull Requests have at least one reviewer. If you are a solo project, consider finding another solo author and trade code reviews!
* A single command compiles, deploys, and runs a suite of tests against your code using a development Ethereum environment (See: Truffle)
* You have run your code through basic code analysis tools such as Mythril and Slither, ideally before each pull request is merged, comparing differences in output
* Solidity does not emit ANY compiler warnings
* Code is well-documented
